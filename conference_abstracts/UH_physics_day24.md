# Abstract for Physics Day '24 by Uni Helsinki

Event link: https://www.helsinki.fi/en/conferences/physics-days-2024/programme

DL: 31.1

Track: Education and outreach 

Plan:

Something along the lines of: 
- What is CR?
- Why would Physicists care?
- How can they participate/access?
- Contact
- https://coderefinery.org/about/impact/ shows that most attendees have been from physics
- > Advertising that CR exists :) 

Draft:

In physics, as in many other domains, research often relies on software written as a by-product of Research. This may have many reasons like the focus on Research publications rather than software and researchers not being adequately prepared to write reusable and sustainable software.  The CodeRefinery project (link here) aims at supporting researchers to write reproducible and sustainable research code no matter their domain or career stage. In currently two workshops (online, free of charge) per year we aim to get researchers started using version control tools to make collaboration with others and your future self more enjoyable and (something else which does not come to mind right now). In addition, tools and concepts around the programming tasks are introduced, such as different ways of documenting code, ensuring (not the right word, as it is more trying to ensure) reproducibility, Sharing Code and licensing, modular code development and automatic testing. 
xxx have joined our workshops over the last 8 (?) years and the feedback was mainly positive. We are constantly working on improving the materials and workshop format based on your feedback.

But codererinery is not just workshops, it also is a community of people that enjoy helping others write better code and use computing resources efficiently. The Community is tightly knit to Nordic-RSE (link here), an association of Research Software engineers in the Nordics and Baltics.

If you enjoy RSE, consider joining!
