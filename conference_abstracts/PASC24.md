# PASC 2024 poster abstract submission

Submission deadline 22.12.23

## Topic (max 20 words)

CodeRefinery - Teaching FAIR research software development to researchers

## Domain

NOTE: None quite fits, but mabye closest are those two?

Computational engineering, 
Applied Social Sciences and Humanities 

## Author details (full names and contact details)

## Abstract for publication (max 200 words)

NOTE: currently 198 words

CodeRefinery is a project funded by Nordic e-infrastructure collaboration (NeiC) supporting students and researchers 
across all research fields by teaching FAIR research software and development and basic Research Software Engineering practices. 
The training materials are developed collaboratively and publicly using markdown, Sphinx and Github-pages. 
Everything is open source and can be reused, remixed and extended upon under CC-BY 4.0 license.
The initiative has successfully held interactive hands-on online and free workshops based on these materials on computational Science topics for over 300 registrants at a time. 
Particularly well liked topics are the introduction to collaborative distributed version control, software documentation and modular code development. 
The lesson on reproducible research aims on summarizing the whole workshop and putting it into the context of participants current or future work.
The bi-annual workshops themselves combine livestream, co-teaching, parallelized and threaded questions and answers as well as parallel connected in-person events. 
Leaving the traditional online teaching strategy and creating our own visiion of how online teaching could be required adjusting to alternative technologies and mindset. 
This contribution aims at sharing our current teaching strategy as well as our lessons learned from developing our workshop style 
and open lesson materials over the years.

+ something on why it should be at this conference: RSE related events last year, scientists need to know this kind of stuff exists
+ the relation to HPC
+ more details on curriculum and other related courses
+ some details from earlier post workshops surveys
+ growing next generation RSE which are important for HPC too
