## Description

### General Information

**Title of the tutorial**: Best Practices in HPC Training
**Tutorial author(s) information**: SW, MJ, DI, TW, ...

### Abstract (Maximum words: 200)

This tutorial will focus on helping competent practitioners and experts teach their knowledge to others. It also serves a kickstart to teach existing open-source training materials on software engineering best practices from CodeRefinery and various HPC topics from NCC-Sweden, WRITEME ...

The material presented here is partly derived from two instructor training resources developed in the CodeRefinery project as well as the instructor training lesson from The Carpentries:

- CodeRefinery Community Teaching
- CodeRefinery Instructor Training
- Carpentries Instructor Training

Inspiration has also been drawn from the free online book Teaching Tech Together by Greg Wilson.

After attending a workshop covering this material, learners should:
- Have increased confidence in teaching interactive workshops in online and in-person settings.
- Be familiar with important pedagogical concepts and scientific findings about how people learn new skills.
- Appreciate the importance of frequent hands-on practice in building skill.
- Understand how learning can be improved by following certain best practices in interactive teaching.
- Know how to backwards-design training material based on intended learning outcomes.
- Know about important differences between online and in-person training and how inherent challenges in online training can be overcome.
- Be familiar with a technical approach to collaboratively developing open source lessons based on a template.


### Detailed description of the tutorial content (Maximum pages: 3)

**Overview and goals of the tutorial (takeaways for the audience)**


**Targeted audience**

Teaching is a profession, but also something that everyone needs to be able to do to some degree, since everyone has their own personal specialties they will either teach or mentor.

This course can be relevant for different learner personas:

- **You run a practical teaching program** at your institution (for example as part of a research computing group) and would like to learn best practices for collaborative teaching of technical topics, so that you aren’t re-inventing the same thing over and over again.
- **You are a technical specialist** who is frustrated with the way you currently try to teach others who need to use your software or infrastructure. You can’t spend too much time to become a professional, but you know you need something more than what you’ve been doing. Thus, you would like to adopt some of the best practices of designing and teaching interactive, hands-on workshops.
- **You’ve been teaching alone**, but would like to join a collaboration network for more co-teaching and to reduce the amount of duplication of effort.
- **You are interested in teaching CodeRefinery/ENCCS/... lessons**, and would like a comprehensive kick-start to how ENCCS workshops work, either to join us, or teach our lessons with us or independently.

**Detailed outline of the tutorial (with time slots)**

- take columns 2-3 from https://enccs.github.io/instructor-training/guide/

**Description of hands-on activities, if applicable**

- group work in groups of different sizes
- WRITEME

**Updates from previous presentations, if applicable**


**Number of attendees from previous tutorials, if applicable**
- probably asking about previous ISC tutorials

**URLs to sample slides and other material**

## Logistics

**Length of the tutorial: half-day (3.5 hours) or full-day (7 hours)**

full-day 7 hours

**Percentage of content split as beginner/intermediate or intermediate/advanced**

50% beginner/intermediate, 50% intermediate/advanced


**Requirements for attendees (e.g., laptop, remote server account)**
