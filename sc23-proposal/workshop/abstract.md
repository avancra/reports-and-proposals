# Abstract for the workshop [Research Software Engineers in HPC (RSE-HPC-2023)](https://us-rse.org/rse-hpc-2023/)

Title: "CodeRefinery: Training researchers and RSEs in FAIR tools and
practices"

CodeRefinery is a project funded by Nordic e-Infrastructure Collaboration
(NeIC) supporting students, researchers, and RSEs across all research fields by
teaching FAIR research software engineering practices.

All CodeRefinery team members are involved in HPC training at their national or
local organizations and bring their knowledge and experiences into the project
or vice-versa. Our public CodeRefinery chat also serves as a hub for
information exchange and support for everyone interested.

One core part of the project is the development of lesson material and the
organization of a bi-annual workshop on software engineering practices which
are needed for modern collaborative computational research but are often missed
in a traditional university curriculum.

The CodeRefinery teaching model for these workshops combines live-streaming,
co-teaching, parallelized and threaded questions and answers, and parallel
in-person events followed via stream. This strategy has been applied to
teaching events with over 500 registered participants.

In this contribution we will share our experiences and lessons learned from
developing and evolving the CodeRefinery lesson curriculum and course format
from over 50 events organized. We will also share insights gained from growing
a community of instructors and research software engineers with the goal of
improving software engineering practices and thus the quality of computational
research and engineering.
