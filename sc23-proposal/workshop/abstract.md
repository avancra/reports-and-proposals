# Abstract for the workshop [Research Software Engineers in HPC (RSE-HPC-2023)](https://us-rse.org/rse-hpc-2023/)

Title: "CodeRefinery: training researchers and RSEs in FAIR tools and practices"

(What is CR?)
CodeRefinery is a project funded by Nordic e-Infrastructure Collaboration (NeIC) supporting students and researchers across all research fields by teaching FAIR research software engineering practices.

(Why we are at "RSE in HPC" event)
Many of the CodeRefinery core team work in or around HPC and bring their knowledge and experiences into the project or vice-versa. All CodeRefinery team members are involved in HPC training at their national or local organizations. Our public CodeRefinery chat also serves as a hub for information exchange and support for everyone interested. 

(Workshops)
One core part of the project is the development of lesson material and the organization of a bi-annual workshop on software engineering practices which are needed for modern collaborative computational research but are often missed in a traditional university curriculum.

(Teaching-style)
The CodeRefinery teaching model combines live-streaming, co-teaching, parallelized and threaded questions and answers, and parallel in-person events followed via stream. This strategy has been applied to teaching events with over 500 registered participants. 

(This contribution; shortened from SIAM CSE abstract)
In this contribution we will share our experiences and lessons learned from developing and evolving the lesson curriculum and course format, from organizing over 50 events and from growing a community of instructors and research software engineers with the goal of improving software engineering practices and thus the quality of computational research and engineering.
